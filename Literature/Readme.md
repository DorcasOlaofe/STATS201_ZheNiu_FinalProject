# Part II: Literature

Our research on predicting obesity risk levels through machine learning models intricately connects to and advances existing research in several critical ways. Drawing on a diverse range of studies, our methodology incorporates and builds upon the foundation laid by these scholars.

## Connection to Existing Research

- **Machine Learning in Obesity (DeGregory et al., 2018):** Our work aligns with DeGregory et al.'s review by utilizing rich datasets from various sources, including electronic medical records and health surveys, to understand obesity. We apply advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, echoing their emphasis on the utility of such methods in obesity prediction and classification.

- **Obesity Risk Prediction (Ferdowsy et al., 2021):** Ferdowsy et al.'s approach to obesity risk prediction using machine learning algorithms resonates with our methodology. Our study extends their work by not only predicting obesity risk with high accuracy but also identifying the most influential predictors, thereby providing insights into the underlying causes of obesity.

- **Age-specific Risk Factors (Jeon, Lee, & Oh, 2023):** By incorporating age-specific risk factors into our analysis, our research takes inspiration from Jeon et al.'s study. We further this exploration by assessing the impact of these factors across different machine learning models to identify the most accurate and reliable predictors of obesity.

- **Systematic Literature Review on Obesity Classification (Tandiono & Sanjaya, 2024):** Our study benefits from the comprehensive review conducted by Tandiono and Sanjaya, which highlights key risk factors and machine learning methods for obesity prediction. We advance this work by applying these insights to develop optimized predictive models that demonstrate enhanced performance and interpretability.

## Advancements Made

- **Feature Importance Evaluation:** Unlike the broader focus of the reviewed literature, our study delves deeper into feature importance evaluation using SHAP values. This approach offers nuanced insights into how different features influence obesity risk predictions, providing a more detailed understanding than traditional methods.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation:** By implementing rigorous hyperparameter tuning with the Optuna framework and employing cross-validation, our research enhances model accuracy and generalizability. This systematic optimization process distinguishes our work from existing studies by ensuring our models are robust and well-suited for real-world applications.

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Our meticulous data preprocessing strategy, which includes label encoding and the transformation of categorical variables into numerical scores, builds upon the foundational work of previous research. This process ensures a clean, well-structured dataset that maximizes the predictive capabilities of our machine learning models.
